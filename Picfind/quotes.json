 "What i like about photographs is that they capture a moment thatâ€™s gone forever, impossible to reproduce",
 "When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence.",
 "You don't make a photograph just with a camera. You bring to the act of photography all the pictures you have seen, the books you have read, the music you have heard, the people you have loved.",
 "There are no bad pictures; that's just how your face looks sometimes.",
 "When you photograph people in color, you photograph their clothes. But when you photograph people in Black and white, you photograph their souls!",
 "A picture is a secret about a secret, the more it tells you the less you know.",
 "Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second.",
 "The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.",
 "To the complaint, 'There are no people in these photographs,' I respond, There are always two people: the photographer and the viewer",
 "A great photograph is one that fully expresses what one feels, in the deepest sense, about what is being photographed.",
 "For me, the camera is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity",
 "When people look at my pictures I want them to feel the way they do when they want to read a line of a poem twice.",
 "A photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second."
